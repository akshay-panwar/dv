# Truth about effectiveness of COVID-19 Lockdowns

Recently there has been a proliferation of modeling work which has been used to make the point that if we can stay inside, practice extreme social distancing, and generally lock-down nonessential parts of society for several months, then many deaths from COVID-19 can be prevented

For example, a new study by Christopher J.L. Murray at the University of Washington models hospital and ICU utilization and deaths over a 4 month period of mitigations, and estimates that “Total deaths” can be kept under 100,000.

                   Murray’s study estimates hospital and ICU utilization in addition to deaths.

    Like other recent studies considering short-term mitigations, he estimates fewer than 100,000 deaths.
