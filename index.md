# Not the full picture


Recently there has been a proliferation of modeling work which has been used to make the point that if we can stay inside, practice extreme social distancing, and generally lock-down nonessential parts of society for several months, then many deaths from COVID-19 can be prevented

For example, a new study by Christopher J.L. Murray at the University of Washington models hospital and ICU utilization and deaths over a 4 month period of mitigations, and estimates that “Total deaths” can be kept under 100,000.

               Murray’s study estimates hospital and ICU utilization in addition to deaths.

    Like other recent studies on short-term mitigations, he estimates fewer than 100,000 deaths.


A similar story is told by a recent model developed by a group of researchers and publicized by Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times. Their basic message? Social distancing for 2 months instead of 2 weeks could dramatically drop the number of COVID-19 infections:

    The model presents a dramatic benefit from 2 months of social distancing instead of 2 weeks.


## Hiding infections in the future is not the same as avoiding them

A keen figure-reader will notice something peculiar in Kristof’s figure. At the tail end of his “Social distancing for 2 months” scenario, there is an intriguing rise in the number of infections (could it be exponential?), right before the figure ends. That’s because of an inevitable feature of realistic models of epidemics; **once transmission rates return to normal, the epidemic will proceed largely as it would have without mitigations, unless a significant fraction of the population is immune (either because they have recovered from the infection or because an effective vaccine has been developed), or the infectious agent has been completely eliminated, without risk of reintroduction.**

## So, what is the reality?

The truth for this Social distancing for 2 months scenario is this:

      This is exactly the same model for “2 months of mitigations”, but extended past October

### A more comprehensive model:

     With no mitigations we see nearly 500,000 deaths relatively quickly

    With mitigations which let up between 6 months and a year we still see nearly 500K deaths, just later

## For two months of containment to be better than two weeks of containment, the situation on the ground has to change

There is a simple truth behind the problems with these modeling conclusions. **The duration of containment efforts does not matter**, if transmission rates return to normal when they end, and mortality rates have not improved. This is simply because **as long as a large majority of the population remains uninfected, lifting containment measures will lead to an epidemic almost as large as would happen without having mitigations in place at all.** 

This is not to say that there are not good reasons to use mitigations as a delay tactic. For example, we may hope to use the months we buy with containment measures to improve hospital capacity, in the hopes of achieving a reduction in the mortality rate. We might even wish to use these months just to consider our options as a society and formulate a strategy. But mitigations themselves are not saving lives in these scenarios; instead, it is what we do with the time that gives us an opportunity to improve the outcome of the epidemic.
